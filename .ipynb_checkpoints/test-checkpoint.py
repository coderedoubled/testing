// twosum 
// Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.
// You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
// Example:

// Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9,
def twoSum(nums:int, int:target):
    d = {}
    for i, n in enumerate(nums):
        m = target - n
        if m in d:
            return [d[m], i]
        else:
            d[n] = i
    return []
